## About
> Just want to export all your books from your bookstack instance without touching the UI?

bookstack-export is a simple helper tool that can download all books from your bookstack instance in the format you choose (pdf, markdown or html).
In the bookstack UI you can only export one book at a time. This tool uses the bookstack API to export all books in parallel.

## Prerequirements

A bookstack user with export rights to all books and a API token.

## Usage

```sh
docker run --name bookstack-exporter --rm -v "/$(pwd)/export":/export -e BOOKSTACK_URL=https://localhost:8443 -e BOOKSTACK_TOKEN=<token_id>:<token_secret> -e EXPORT_FORMAT=html fjuette/bookstack-exporter:0.0.1
```

The `EXPORT_FORMAT` is optional, default is `pdf`. Valid format are `html`, `pdf` and `markdown`.
Mount a local directory to save the exported files outside the container.

### Example output
